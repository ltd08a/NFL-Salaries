# NFL-Salaries
### Introduction
This project takes a closer look into salary cap percentges by position and how these correlate to team success. The data spans from the 2011 to 2023 seasons. By examining the relationship between cap hit percentages and winning this project will show not only which positions are the highest paid, but which of those investments is actually paying off. 
### Data Sources
The team statistical data is from a Kaggle dataset called 'NFL Team Data 2003-2023'. Nick Cantalupa is the author of this dataset. It contains various team stats, including year, team, win/loss percentage, and various other data points. This file was renamed as 'team_stats_2003_2023'.    
The dataset containing salary cap data is called 'nfl_team_cap_data'. This dataset was pulled from spotrac.com and formatted into a pandas DataFrame to use in the analysis.    
To determine which teams made the playoffs I pulled data from Wikipedia.org. Once the data was brought into the environment it was exported into a csv file called 'nfl_playoff_teams.csv'. It shows every team that made the playoffs by year.
